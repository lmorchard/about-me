I don't like writing my own bio. So, I've been kicking around that too-clever
thing above for the last decade or so. Seems like it's been a stable

What I like better than writing a bio is tinkering with code and
data. So, the rest of this page is a collection of my personal data
exhaust. It might offer a better idea of what I'm about.
