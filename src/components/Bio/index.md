While I like writing, I don't much like writing my own bio. So, I've been
kicking around that too-clever psuedo-technical thing above for the last decade
or so.  I guess that means it's been a pretty stable description.

What I like even better than writing my own bio is tinkering with code and
data. So, the rest of this page is a collection of my public personal data
exhaust on the web. It might offer a better idea of what I'm about.
