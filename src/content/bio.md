I don't like writing my own bio. So, I've been kicking around that too-clever
thing above for the last decade or so. Seems like it's been a stable
description, if you don't mind reading curly braces.

Tinkering with data & code is something I like *much* better than writing a bio.
So, the rest of this page is a collection of my personal data exhaust and featured
projects.
