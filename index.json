IIRC, I think [this bugfix for on_delete=SET_NULL](https://github.com/mozilla/experimenter/commit/7385e50dbc0a2651b8ffb349da37c4d41b6c5b8f#diff-36bd393fce70ef5fc7ad821bc3c232a4b00882f000583f222fc3041f735d3bdbR156) needed to land first. The experiment itself would get deleted without explicitly setting `experiment.reference_branch = None` first. But, this works now so yay!",

We should probably dilineate it as\n\n- Initializing the UI component uses the Query type to display currently saved values\n- The reducer and gql call wrapper should use the Input type to store the writeable data\n\n┆Issue is synchronized with this [Jira Task](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/browse/EXP-1921)\n",

      "body": "Update the PageResults component, tests, and Storybook stories so that they use React Context.\n\nLargely, update the component to pull properties out of the ExperimentContext. For example: \n\n```java\nconst { experiment, status, review } = useContext(ExperimentContext);\n```\n\nSome things to keep in mind:\n\n* Some larger refactoring will be needed to replace function-as-child setups in some components (e.g. [PageEditAudience](https://github.com/mozilla/experimenter/blob/main/app/experimenter/nimbus-ui/src/components/PageEditAudience/index.tsx#L24-L25)), but generally we should be able to eliminate this along with the hacky refs to experiment data and the refetch function.\n* Usage of `getStatus` and `useReviewCheck` in components can now be replaced by pulling these properties out of the ExperimentContext.\n* The component should no longer take props such as `experiment`, `status`, or anything review-related since these can be extracted from the context. However it should still provide these props to child components until they are migrated to context as well.\n* Tests and stories that use `mockExperimentQuery` or similar mocks should instead now wrap the component in `MockExperimentContextProvider` to mock the properties the component retrieves from the context.\n\nFor bonus points (but not necessary if the diff is already getting large), when updating stories you could consider transitioning them to the new format. Check [these stories](https://github.com/mozilla/experimenter/blob/main/app/experimenter/nimbus-ui/src/components/AppLayoutWithSidebar/index.stories.tsx) out for an example.\n\n┆Issue is synchronized with this [Jira Task](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/browse/EXP-1604)\n",

      "body": "Update the PageEditBranches component, tests, and Storybook stories so that they use React Context.\n\nLargely, update the component to pull properties out of the ExperimentContext. For example: \n\n```java\nconst { experiment, status, review } = useContext(ExperimentContext);\n```\n\nSome things to keep in mind:\n\n* Some larger refactoring will be needed to replace function-as-child setups in some components (e.g. [PageEditAudience](https://github.com/mozilla/experimenter/blob/main/app/experimenter/nimbus-ui/src/components/PageEditAudience/index.tsx#L24-L25)), but generally we should be able to eliminate this along with the hacky refs to experiment data and the refetch function.\n* Usage of `getStatus` and `useReviewCheck` in components can now be replaced by pulling these properties out of the ExperimentContext.\n* The component should no longer take props such as `experiment`, `status`, or anything review-related since these can be extracted from the context. However it should still provide these props to child components until they are migrated to context as well.\n* Tests and stories that use `mockExperimentQuery` or similar mocks should instead now wrap the component in `MockExperimentContextProvider` to mock the properties the component retrieves from the context.\n\nFor bonus points (but not necessary if the diff is already getting large), when updating stories you could consider transitioning them to the new format. Check [these stories](https://github.com/mozilla/experimenter/blob/main/app/experimenter/nimbus-ui/src/components/AppLayoutWithSidebar/index.stories.tsx) out for an example.\n\n┆Issue is synchronized with this [Jira Task](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/browse/EXP-1601)\n",

Navigating away to another page like PageEditOverview causes the cleanup handler from `useEffect` to run and disable polling. \r\n\r\nThe `SubjectPollingEnabler` component just exercises `useExperimentPolling` in isolation. Waiting for the `polling-enabled` element to appear / disappear just ensures all the side effects have happened before manipulating the timer",
