# About Me

This is an experiment at building an About Me page for lmorchard.com as an
old-school Web 2.0 mashup using my own personal data exhaust.

Some highlights:

* Local dev server with hot module reloading for both components and initial
  state data

* Production static site build with only selective live components on the
  client to minimize bundle size

* Simple modular data fetching tool

* Publish to S3 or somewhere similar
