# Les Orchard

> Software developer, writer, and author with 25+ years building on the web. Wrote books on RSS, feeds, and del.icio.us in the 2000s. Built developer tools at Mozilla for over a decade. Tinkering with personal projects around RSS feeds, IndieWeb practices, and tools for managing personal digital content. Active in open source and the decentralized web.

## About

I'm a web developer who has been building things on the internet since 1995. I describe myself as a "serial enthusiast" - my ADHD brain leads to bursts of intense focus on projects, then moving on to the next interesting challenge. I embrace this pattern rather than fighting it, which has led to exploring many different technologies and problem spaces over the years.

I've worked at Mozilla, GitHub, and Yahoo, contributed to Firefox, del.icio.us, and MDN, and authored several technical books in the 2000s on RSS, feeds, and JavaScript frameworks.

**Education**: B.S. Computer Science and Psychology, *cum laude*, Central Michigan University (1997)

- [mastodon-to-markdown](https://github.com/lmorchard/mastodon-to-markdown): Export Mastodon toots to Markdown format.

**Blogging & Content**
- [blog.lmorchard.com](https://blog.lmorchard.com): Personal blog since early 2000s covering web development, RSS, IndieWeb, tinkering, and metablogging.
- [Easy-Blog Oven](https://github.com/lmorchard/blog.lmorchard.com): Custom Node.js static site generator integrated with Obsidian for frictionless publishing.
- [weeknotes-blog-post-composer](https://github.com/lmorchard/lmorchard-agent-skills/tree/main/weeknotes-blog-post-composer): Claude Code skill for drafting blog posts from aggregated social media and bookmark data.

**Personal Infrastructure**
- [about-me](https://github.com/lmorchard/about-me): This site - aggregates blog posts, GitHub activity, Mastodon toots, and media consumption across platforms.

## Writing & Themes

My blog explores:
- **RSS & Feed Readers**: Building tools that respect reader autonomy, "river of news" patterns, alternatives to algorithmic feeds. Continues themes from *Hacking RSS and Atom* (2005).
- **IndieWeb & PESOS**: Own your content, syndication strategies, decentralized web practices.
- **Web Development**: Web components, static site generation, progressive enhancement, modern JavaScript.
- **Metablogging**: Writing about writing, sustainable creative practices, blogging as "search query to find fascinating people".
- **Tinkering**: Retrocomputing (Commodore 64, BBS systems), homelabs, ESP32 projects, 3D printing.

Key concepts:
- **Serial Enthusiasm**: Embracing rather than fighting bursts of intense project focus. [Confessions of a Serial Enthusiast](https://blog.lmorchard.com/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast/) (2006)
- **Pebbling**: Finding and sharing interesting things like penguins presenting shiny pebbles. Being a "human repeater" for interesting content.
- **River of News**: Feed reading without inbox anxiety or read/unread state. Inspired by Dave Winer's philosophy.
- **PESOS**: Publish Elsewhere, Syndicate (to your) Own Site. Collecting social media posts and reshaping them for my own blog.
